Quick start instructions
------------------------
1.  Install GMP and OPENBLAS.
2.  Build.
      $> make all
3.  Install to ../maple/lib/ (see defs.mk INSTALL_DIR).
      $> make install

The hnfproj package provides routines for efficiently computing the Hermite
normal form of a square, nonsingular integer matrix.

Additional notes
----------------
This package requires both GMP (http://gmplib.org/) and OPENBLAS.  
Require passing the following four variables to make (see defs.mk to make changes).
  OPENBLAS_INCLUDE_DIR=<...>
  OPENBLAS_LIB_DIR=<...>
  GMP_INCLUDE_DIR=<...>
  GMP_LIB_DIR=<...>

bin/      - example executables
include/  - header for external callers
lib/      - static and shared libraries

src/      - main source tree
examples/ - source for example applications
tests/    - unit tests and utilities

Build targets
-------------
     make all - Makes examples, lib, shared, and version targets
make examples - Builds example executables:
                  - bin/hor_main
                  - bin/iherm_main
                  - bin/simple_iherm
                  - bin/unicert_main
   make tests - Runs unit test suite. (Broken)
 make version - Builds version checking utility: bin/version (broken)

     make lib - Builds static library: lib/liblift.a
  make shared - Builds shared library: lib/liblift.so
   make clean - Remove contents of objs/, lib/, and bin/ directories
 make install - Install to INSTALL_DIR (see defs.mk)
